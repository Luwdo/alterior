# @alterior/logging

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@alterior/logging.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alterior/logging)

## Overview

Provides a dependency-injected logger with support for pluggable listeners and log context tracking using `Zone.js`

## Installation

```
npm install @alterior/logging
```

## Usage 

This module is intended to be used as part of an Alterior application. Several of the higher level first-party Alterior modules use this logger already, so it is a natural fit.

The module provides a `Logger` injectable when `LoggingModule` is imported into your Alterior application:

```typescript
@Module({
    imports: [ LoggingModule ]
})
export class MyEntryModule { }
```

Once the module is imported, you can inject `Logger` into your services, controllers, tasks, etc:

```typescript
import { Logger } from '@alterior/logging';
// ...

@Controller('/foo')
export class MyController {
    constructor(
        private logger : Logger
    ) {
    }

    @Get('/')
    get() {
        this.logger.info('Hello, world!');
    }
}

// [2019-03-05T00:12:44Z] [source="MyController"] info: Hello, world!
```

## Subloggers (Source Labels)

You may wish to specifically mark logs which came from a particular class (or any other programmatic unit):

```typescript

import { Logger } from '@alterior/logging';
// ...

@Injectable()
export class MyService {
    constructor(
        logger : Logger
    ) {
        this.logger = logger.withSource(this)
    }

    private logger : Logger;

    doSomething() {
        this.logger.info('Hello, world!');
    }
}

// [2019-03-05T00:12:44Z] [source="MyService"] info: Hello, world!
```

As you can see, `withSource(object)` will use the object's constructor name as the source label. You can also pass a string to set the source label to any string you wish.

## Context tracking

This library also provides "context tracking" using `Zone.js`. When using context tracking, logs which occur inside a code block will be specially marked, even if the code is asynchronous or delayed.

```typescript
logger.withContext({ myContextData: 123 }, `The data is 123`, () => {
    setTimeout(() => logger.info(`Hello, world!`), 1000);
});

// [2019-03-05T00:12:44Z] [context="The data is 123"] info: Hello, world!
```

This is the mechanism that allows `@alterior/web-server` and `@alterior/tasks` to include the current request trace inside logs generated by reusable services. This results in logs that are easier to follow,
especially when there is heavy concurrency within a single log file (ie web servers, task runners):

```
[2019-03-05T00:12:44Z] [source="MyService" context="GET /foo | 1443c985-c4be-47f7-9e9c-941c21913def"] info: Hello, world!
[2019-03-05T00:12:44Z] [source="MyService" context="TaskWorker | MyBackgroundWorker"] info: Hello, world!
```

## Configuration

To configure the module, import it into your entry module and specify options in the call to `configure()`:

```typescript
@Module({
    imports: [ LoggingModule.configure({ /* ... */ }) ]
})
export class MyEntryModule { }
```

### `listeners`

"Listeners" are responsible for reporting logs in one way or another. By default a sensibly-configured `ConsoleLogger` is used. If you wish to customize the format, you'll need to specify your own instance of `ConsoleLogger`. If an empty set of listeners is specified, logs will effectively be dropped, and the logger itself becomes a no-op.

## Log Objects

Log messages are passed to listeners as objects conforming to the `LogMessage` interface:

```typescript
export interface LogMessage {
    message : string;
    context : any;
    contextLabel : string;
    sourceLabel : string;
    severity : LogSeverity;
    date : Date;
}
```

It is the responsibility of the listener to decide how to format these log message objects. Some listeners may not format the object at all (for instance: recording logs to a collection in an object store like MongoDB).

## Log Formatting

Some built-in loggers use `LogFormatter` to handle transforming a log object into a string suitable for use on a screen, log file, etc. `LogFormatter` accepts a format string to determine how to transform the log message object into a string. Bare text is treated literally, and the fields of the `LogMessage` can be referenced by surrounding the name of the field with '%'. The default format for builtin listeners is:

```
%date% [source="%sourceLabel%" context="%contextLabel%"] %severity%: %message%
```

## Available Listeners

### `new ConsoleLogger(formatString)`

Outputs the log to the console using `console.log()` and friends. Accepts a format string suitable for use with `LogFormatter`.

### `new FileLogger(formatString, filename)`

Writes logs to the specified file. Accepts a format string suitable for use with `LogFormatter`.
